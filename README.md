**terminator** is an ai-first cross-platform ui automation library for rust, designed to interact with native gui applications on windows and macos using a playwright-like api.

it provides a unified api to find and control ui elements like buttons, text fields, windows, and more. because it uses os-level accessibility apis, it is **100x faster and more reliable** for ai agents than vision-based approaches.

`terminator` can also parse and interact with background apps/windows, unlike vision based approach.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note 1 ‚ö†Ô∏è:** while we support macos and windows, we are currently focusing development efforts on windows, so you will have to figure out yourself how to use the macos version.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note 2 ‚ö†Ô∏è:** keep in mind it's very experimental, expect many bugs, report it and we'll fix in minutes.
